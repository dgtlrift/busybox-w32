Looked at using either:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/syslog-win32/
	settled on
	https://github.com/asankah/syslog-win32

Would like to reference the library instead of pulling it in:
	for example, have a Kbuild rule that downloads the modules instead of embedding them here as part of the commit.

Something like...
syslog-win32:
	git clone https://github.com/asankah/syslog-win32.git &&
	for f in ./syslog-win32/* ; do
		ln -s -n ${f}
	done

This way the source doesn't need to be included... could be done with submodules I guess, but in short - Kbuild needs someway to allow defining, finding, and pulling external dependancies that are beyond the scope of the current project.
